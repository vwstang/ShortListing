# ShortListing

## Overview

### What the heck is ShortListing anyway?

Looking for your next dream home? Found a bunch of potential candidates but having trouble deciding between them? Not able to easily summarize all the details into a visualization that can help you make an informed decision?

I hear you. I found myself throwing a bunch of details onto spreadsheets just to be able to quickly compare specific data on potential houses that I'd want to place offers for. That's what ShortListing is for.

### So it's a really terrible portmanteau of `shortlist` and `listing`?

Hey, naming stuff is hard okay? Besides, aren't you here to see the code?
