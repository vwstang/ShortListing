# ShortListing :house_with_garden:

### What the heck is ShortListing anyway?

Looking for your next dream home? Found a bunch of potential candidates but having trouble deciding between them? Not able to easily summarize all the details into a visualization that can help you make an informed decision?

I hear you. I found myself throwing a bunch of details onto spreadsheets just to be able to quickly compare specific data on potential houses that I'd want to place offers for. That's what ShortListing is for.

### So it's a really terrible portmanteau of `shortlist` and `listing`?

Hey, naming stuff is hard okay? Besides, aren't you here to see the code?

## Getting started

### Development

1. Clone repository to local.

   `git clone https://github.com/vwstang/ShortListing.git`

1. Install dependencies.

   `npm i`

1. Open two terminals:

   a. In one terminal, run `npm run webpack`

   b. Once webpack is built and watching, run `npm start` in the other terminal

1. Once `nodemon` has started the server, navigate to http://localhost:1726 in your browser of choice.

### Dependencies

The following dependency versions cannot be updated at this time:

- `react-leaflet@2.8.0` - `3.0.0` and above introduces a lot of breaking changes that require code changes even at the react level. Also, have not been able to figure out server-side render with it, so it must stay at `2.8.0` for now.

## Project Status and Wiki

Project status found in the `Projects` tab above, or [here](https://github.com/vwstang/ShortListing/projects) if you're lazy.

Development of features currently being worked on and labelled as `enhancement` can be found in `Issues` tab above, or [here](https://github.com/vwstang/ShortListing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement+sort%3Acreated-asc+) if you're still lazy.

Excessive use of GitHub features for a personal project just for the sake of using them? I think not :upside_down_face:
